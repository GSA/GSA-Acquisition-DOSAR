         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Delegations.</em> As stated in 601.603-3(a), there is no contracting officer authority conferred by virtue of position. Pursuant to 601.602-1(b), the Procurement Executive has designated the following as contracting activities as defined in FAR 2.101. These authorities are not redelegable. In addition, specific individuals are designated as heads of contracting activities (HCAs) (<em class="ph i">see</em> FAR 2.101): 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Overseas posts.</em> Each overseas post shall be regarded as a contracting activity to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services. The Principal Officer, the Management Officer, or the Supervisory General Services Officer are designated as HCAs; <em class="ph i">provided,</em> that he/she has a contracting officer's warrant issued by the Procurement Executive.

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) No authority is delegated to enter into cost-reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redeterminable contracts.

Proposed construction contracts exceeding $500,000 and any related architect-engineer contracts must have prior A/OPE approval. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When expressly authorized by a U.S. Government agency which does not have a contracting officer at the post, the officers named in paragraph (a)(1) introductory text of this section may enter into contracts for that agency. Use of this authority is subject to the statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or limitations applicable to the funds of that agency. The agency's authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized must comply. In view of the contracting officer's responsibility for the legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Office of Logistics Management; Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM).</em> The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies and services, including construction, is delegated to the Director or designee as the HCA.
