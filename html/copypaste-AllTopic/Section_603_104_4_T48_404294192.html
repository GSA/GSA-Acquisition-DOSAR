</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) All information which is considered proprietary or source selection information shall be marked to prevent its unauthorized disclosure before award. This may be performed by marking each page of proprietary or source selection material with the statement “Source Selection Information - See FAR 3.104” or “Proprietary Information - See FAR 3.104”, as applicable. Alternatively, this requirement may be met by attaching Forms DS-1926, Proprietary Information (Cover Page), and DS-1927, Source Selection Information (Cover Page), to any proprietary and source selection information. Individuals responsible for preparing derivative documents which reference, cite, or paraphrase proprietary or source selection information, are responsible for marking such documents as indicated in this paragraph. The required marking or cover page shall be included when technical proposals are submitted for evaluation and when an audit is requested. After award, the procedures governing the Freedom of Information Act and related laws/regulations shall be followed regarding release of proprietary or source selection information.
