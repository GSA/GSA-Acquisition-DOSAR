To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person, guidance is hereby provided. For ease of reference, the statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.

Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. A prospective bidder/offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. firm that guarantees performance. To be considered a “qualified United States joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. By signing this bid/proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>
