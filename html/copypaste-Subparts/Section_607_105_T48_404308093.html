         <p class="p Runin List1">(b)(10) Acquisition Plans for support of contract administration and other tasks closely related to inherently governmental functions must include a determination that the services being requested are not inherently governmental and a risk mitigation strategy. Procurement Information Bulletin (PIB) 2011-11, Attachment 1, lists functions requiring additional oversight and potential mitigation strategies.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(b)(19) Acquisition Plans must include planning for contract administration. Planning shall be developed by the bureau technical program office and should consider an initial assessment of resources required for contractor oversight, support, travel and communications. Planning should take into account the need for multiple technical monitors based on geographic dispersion and multiple technical disciplines. Program offices must identify financial and other resources that are reserved for implementation of contract administration.
