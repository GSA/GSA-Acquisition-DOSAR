         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Delegations.</em> As stated in 601.603-3(a), there is no contracting officer authority conferred by virtue of position. Pursuant to 601.602-1(b), the Procurement Executive has designated the following as contracting activities as defined in FAR 2.101. These authorities are not redelegable. In addition, specific individuals are designated as heads of contracting activities (HCAs) (<em class="ph i">see</em> FAR 2.101): 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Overseas posts.</em> Each overseas post shall be regarded as a contracting activity to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services. The Principal Officer, the Management Officer, or the Supervisory General Services Officer are designated as HCAs; <em class="ph i">provided,</em> that he/she has a contracting officer's warrant issued by the Procurement Executive. The Procurement Executive (or authorized A/OPE staff) may delegate to a contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, the authority to award a contract or modification which exceeds the contracting officer's warrant level. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) No authority is delegated to enter into cost-reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redeterminable contracts. Design/build solicitations and contracts may only be entered into with the written approval of A/OPE and OBO. Proposed construction contracts exceeding $500,000 and any related architect-engineer contracts must have prior A/OPE approval. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When expressly authorized by a U.S. Government agency which does not have a contracting officer at the post, the officers named in paragraph (a)(1) introductory text of this section may enter into contracts for that agency. Use of this authority is subject to the statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or limitations applicable to the funds of that agency. The agency's authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized must comply. In view of the contracting officer's responsibility for the legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Office of Logistics Management; Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM).</em> The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies and services, including construction, is delegated to the Director or designee as the HCA.

			Whenever the contracting officer makes use of the various statutory authorities available to the Department to waive the application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or laws governing acquisition, such as those provided in the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2291) or the Foreign Service Buildings Act (22 U.S.C. 294), a written determination of the basis for using the authority must be prepared and included in the file.

				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Government generally is not bound by unauthorized commitments. Unauthorized commitments violate the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the DOSAR, and proper acquisition practice. Therefore, such unauthorized commitments are serious violations that could result in disciplinary action against the transgressor, e.g., withdrawal of a contracting officer's warrant or a Contracting Officer's Representative delegation or collection action.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(2)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			Unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000. The head of the contracting activity is delegated the authority to serve as the ratifying official for unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000, including unauthorized commitments from other agencies where a DOS employee serves as the contracting officer for that action. The head of the contracting activity may refer any actions not exceeding $1,000 to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification if he or she so chooses.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Unauthorized commitments exceeding $1,000. All DOS unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 shall be submitted to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification. Unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 from other agencies may be referred to the other agency's representative at post for resolution in accordance with that agency's ratification process.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Claims.</em> Unauthorized contractual commitments that would involve claims subject to resolution under the Contracts Dispute Act of 1978 shall be processed in accordance with FAR subpart 33.2 and subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Subpart_633_2_T48_40433292.html#Subpart_633_2_T48_40433292">633.2</a>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Disciplinary action.</em> The Procurement Executive may refer egregious cases of unauthorized commitments to HR/ER for possible disciplinary action in accordance with 3 FAM 4370 or 3 FAM 4540. Examples might include repeated unauthorized commitments knowingly made by an employee; failure to take responsibility for a deliberate unauthorized commitment; or similar reasons. The Procurement Executive may revoke the appointment certificate of any contracting officer who makes an unauthorized commitment. The Procurement Executive may direct a contracting officer to revoke the appointment memorandum of a Contracting Officer's Representative or Government Technical Monitor who makes an unauthorized commitment.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) When the person who made the unauthorized contractual commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, an officer from the responsible office shall accomplish the requirements of this paragraph; the statement shall identify the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.

The contracting officer shall either recommend that the ratifying official approve and ratify the unauthorized commitment; or, disapprove the ratification of the unauthorized commitment.

         <p class="p List2">(2) Following the signature of the contracting officer, the recommendation shall include a statement that the ratifying official could have granted authority to enter into a contractual commitment at the time it was made and still has the authority to do so; that the ratifying official hereby ratifies (or disapproves) the unauthorized commitment in the amount specified; and a date and signature block for the ratifying official.

         <p class="p List1">(c) The information required in paragraph (b)

If the request for ratification is not justified, the ratifying official shall return the request to the head of the contracting activity (if over $1,000) or to the contracting officer (if under $1,000) with a written explanation for the decision and a recommendation for disposition of the action.
